>Hello there, my name is Daniel Guillermo Sánchez López. I'm a Venezuelan software engineer currently based in Madrid. I got my bachelor's degree at the Universidad Metropolitana (Caracas, Venezuela) in 2016. I work as a full-stack web developer for an international company in the airline sector. In my day-to-day, I have to deal with different languages and frameworks such as Java, Spring, C#, net core, JavaScript, Angular, Python, and more. Despite this, I still consider myself a Java Backend developer.

>I'd like you to read more about my future projects and thoughts that I'll be posting here.
